# Microbenchmarks

Microbenchmarks is a collection of JMH benchmarks to measure the throughput of various Java code snippets.  The
collection is compiled mostly from encountering Java code that appears to be sub-optimal. In those situations, a
collection of benchmarks are crafted that produce the same outputs but are implemented using different approaches.
